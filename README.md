# Reinforcement Learning
This project implements three reinforcement learning algorithms to race a car around a track.

Features:

* Value Iteration algorithm
* Q-Learning algorithm
* SARSA algorithm
* Two crash conditions:
   * crashed vehicle returns to starting line
   * crashed vehicle is moved to nearest open spot
